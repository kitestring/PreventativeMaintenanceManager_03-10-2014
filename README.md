Industry: Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer Developer & Manufacturer

Department: Hardware & Software Customer Support

GUI: Little to no energy was put forth in developing a robust GUI because I was the end user.

Sample Raw Data: A spreadsheet maintained by the departmental secretary.

Sample Output:

Emails were sent to each of the appropriate service engineers listing their assigned PM customer site visits with useful Metadata (“SampleEmail_Engineer1.png”, “SampleEmail_Engineer2.png”, & “SampleEmail_Engineer3.png”), and a master email to the manager listing all the assigned PM’s for each service engineer (“SampleEmail_ManagerSummary.png”).  A database maintained a record of all assigned tasks.  This image (“ServiceEngineerPM-Table.png”) showed a query for a single service engineer for about 1 year of data.
